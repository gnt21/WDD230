      <hr>
      <p>1. I'm a small company, can I join other companies to get volume to buy cheaper?</p>
      <p>2. I have a process that is not my company's core. Can I find companies interested in absorbing this process?</p>
      <p>3. I need a raw material but I don't know where to find it, is there a centralized catalog on raw materials supplied by companies in the region?</p>
      <p>4. I am interested in opening a business, where can I see the demand that exists today for the type of service I want to provide?</p>
      <p>5. I need to buy a product and I would like to search for the best price. Is there a channel where I can do an auction?</p>
